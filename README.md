# VCF Indexing, Searching, and Browsing

This project is the front-end website for a back-end code written by Fernanda Sanchirico for indexing, searching, and browsing VCF files.

## Details

Fernanda and I were not able to connect the front-end software with the back-end software due to time constraints, so future development of this project should include way for the front end to retrieve the data from the back end code. 

To launch this website on a local server:

In terminal, the user should run "npm run start". This command will open the web browser on the device's primary search engine.

Currently, when a user inputs the directory, the input is saved; however, future developers must communicate that directory with the back end code in order to access the data and process the given request. Additionally, once the request and commands are run on that directory, the browser should retrieve that data from the back-end and then output it onto the current window. To simulate this, the code currently only outputs a string phrase. This supports functionality for the buttoms ands input boxes on the server.
